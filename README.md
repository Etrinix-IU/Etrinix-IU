- Greetings! My name is  @Etrinix-IU aka Ray Chang.
- 
- I’m a 6 year linux enthusiast determined to improve my understanding of Linux system by solving various problems I encounter.
- I currently have the CompTIA A+, Linux+, and Network+ cert and am striving towards RHCSA and Security+.

My untimate goal is to be able to fix any Linux computer issue I or anybody else may encounter through automation, software patching, binary exploitation, programming, or whatever else I could possibly use.
- 
-My current focus beyond random task ideas that may appear (such as writing void linux install scripts for example) is bash scripting and automation via python and ansible.
